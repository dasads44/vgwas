# vgwas - Viral Genome Wide Assocation Studies

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of vgwas is to bring together a selection of helpful functions
for performing viral-gwas as demonstrated in:

Smith, D.A., Fernandez-Antunez, C., Magri, A. et al.Â Viral genome wide
association study identifies novel hepatitis C virus polymorphisms
associated with sofosbuvir treatment failure. Nat Commun 12, 6105
(2021). <https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-25649-6>

## Installation

You can install the development version of vgwas from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dasads44/vgwas")
```

## Example

This package is still a work in progress examples and test data to come

## To Do

- Add test data
- Add examples
- Re factor to use summarised experiment object?
- Viral PCA
  - Change scaling defaults for pca
  - Add additional plots and summarisation tools
- Improve plotting
  - Add in genome maps to Manhattan plots
  - Add re factor qqggplots to accept GWAS output
- Add vignettes
- Tests for additional virus genomes
