\title{Generate a Quantile-Quantile Plot for Association Results}
\usage{
qqggplot(results)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{A data.frame or data.table output from the genomeAssociation function,
containing at minimum a 'p.val' column with association p-values.}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object containing the QQ plot, which can be further modified or
        directly printed.
}
\description{
Creates a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot to visualize the distribution of p-values
from genome-wide association studies. This helps to assess whether the observed
p-values deviate from the expected distribution under the null hypothesis.
}
\details{
The QQ plot compares the observed -log10(p-values) against their expected values
under the null hypothesis (uniform distribution). Deviations from the diagonal line
indicate potential systematic bias in the test statistics or the presence of true
associations.

The x-axis represents the expected -log10(p) values, calculated as:
-log10(rank/(n+1)), where rank is the rank of each p-value and n is the total number
of tests.

The y-axis represents the observed -log10(p) values.
